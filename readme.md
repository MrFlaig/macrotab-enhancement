# FoundryVTT Macro Sidebar: Quick Run & Edit Context

This module changes the behavior of the FoundryVTT Macro Sidebar:

* **Left-click** on a macro in the sidebar immediately executes it (instead of opening the configuration dialog).
* **Right-click** on a macro shows a context menu with a new "Edit Macro" entry at the top, so you can still open and edit the macro sheet.

Works with Foundry VTT version 13+ (tested on dnd5e 5.x and Foundry core v13+).
